## About Me

I am an undergraduate student of [Dept. of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), China. I am a member of the Elite Program of Computer Science and my current GPA is 4.6/5.0 (ranking 5/204).   I am expected to receive my Bachelor of Science degree in June, 2021.

Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).

I am now seeking for a **thesis-based master/Ph.D. position** in Fall 2021. If you are interested in hiring me, please feel free to contact me anytime via email enmeng-liu@outlook.com

## Research Interest

I am currently interested in the field of **Software Engineering**. I am eager to explore the "magics" of software development infrastructures.  My goal is to help as many developers as I can with my own knowledge. More specific research interests are to be discovered during my graduate study.

## Research Experience

#### Understanding Compilation Errors Among Novice Software Developers (Working in Progress)

+ Supervisor: Dr. [Yanyan Jiang](http://ics.nju.edu.cn/~jyy)
+ My supervisor has collected a large-scale dataset of auto-traced git-logs in students' programming assignments. My job is to analyze the **causes** and **fixing patterns** of  the **compile errors (CE)**  made by the students, typical representatives of novice programmers. I hope the findings of this work will provide more insights into the enhancement of the readability of today's programming tutorials and compilers' error messages.
